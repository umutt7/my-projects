        <p>Hello! My name is <b>Umut</b>, and this is my week 7 problem set of <b>CS50x</b>.</p>
        <p>I'm just learning <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>. This website will include
            the things that I learned, I hope.
        </p>
        <p>I wish I know how to make this website prettier, but I hope you like what you are going to see.</p>
        <p>But to make things more interesting, I will get help and use different blocks that's been provided by Bootstrap.</p>
        <p>Here are the things you can do in this website:</p>

                   In this page, which I created, you will see different multiple-choice and open ended questions. Depending on your answer, you will be alerted with your result, like "Correct!" or "Incorrect!"

                    By using the things that I learned from the Lecture 8, I tried to create an imitation of Google's main page, where you can search something. Even though it will look like so unreal, the search bar will actually works.
                    Click <a href="search.html"><b>HERE</b></a> to visit the searching page.

                    During CS50x, we completed different problem sets and homeworks. In this page, you can see and test one of them yourself.
                    In this homework, named Speller, we've been given a large dictionary that includes more than a hundred thousand words. But the one in this page works different.
                    You can start writing a word. During your writing, the program will try to autocomplete your word.
                    Click <a href="autocompleter.html"><b>HERE</b></a> to visit my previous homeworks.

          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>I was born in <b>1998</b>. I'm currently studying computer science in Turkey. To learn more things and help my studies, I'm also attending <b>David J. Malan's CS50x course</b>.
            As you can guess and as I said before, this webpage is one of my homeworks. I tried to create a little functional and responsive webpage by using the information I learned.
          </p>
          <p>I love playing video games, especially first-person-shooters and open-worlds. Some of my favorite games are <b>CS:GO, Apex Legends, and Red Dead Redemption 2</b>.
            I also love listening to music. I don't have a specific favorite genre, but I listen to different playlists that includes mostly hip-hop and rap songs.
            Some of my favorite artists are <b>Travis Scott, Frank Ocean, Lil Peep, and XXXTENTACION</b>.
